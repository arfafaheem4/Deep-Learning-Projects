🚲 Bike Rental Prediction using Machine Learning & ANN
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the daily bike rental count using Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
The goal is to analyze environmental and seasonal factors such as:
Season
Month
Weekday
Weather situation
Temperature
Humidity
Windspeed
and predict how many bikes will be rented on a given day.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Bike Sharing Dataset (Daily version), which contains:

Date information

Weather conditions

Seasonal indicators

Temperature & humidity

Daily bike rental count (cnt)

The target variable for prediction is:

cnt → Total bike rentals per day
🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Gradio (for deployment UI)

🔍 Models Implemented

The following models were trained and evaluated:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using:

Grid Search

Bayesian Optimization

📈 Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

Example ANN Results:

MAE: 519.99
RMSE: 692.54
R2 Score: 0.8598
📖 Interpretation:

MAE ≈ 520 → On average, prediction error is about 520 bikes.

RMSE ≈ 692 → Larger errors are penalized more heavily.

R² ≈ 0.86 → Model explains about 86% of variance in bike rentals.

This indicates strong predictive performance.

🧠 ANN Architecture

Input Layer (based on encoded features)

Hidden Layers with optimized neurons
